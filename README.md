# Collision Objects Parser

This packages can parse collision objects from a URDF to a MoveIt CollisionObject message. 

**This package is under development by an intern! The API is extremly unstable and incomplete.**

Load collision objects from a URDF to a planning scene. 
```shell
# Open Panda demo in another terminal
# roslaunch moveit_resources_panda_moveit_config demo.launch

roslaunch scene_parser load_urdf.launch
```
